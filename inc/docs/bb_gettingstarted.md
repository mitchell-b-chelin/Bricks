[ACF Blocks](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/)  
[Wordpress Blocks](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/)
[GitHub Bricks](https://github.com/mitchell-b-chelin/Bricks)

This plugin relies on [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) to register blocks with ACF fields. Addtionally there is a prototype method that allows for blocks to render without it minus some features. 

Bricks allows you to build blocks with full features **fast** no need to compile or use react, Native or JSX just design your template set a json file and your done.

## Setup
After installing bricks to your wordpress instance create a new folder named templates and a folder within that named brick in your themes directory ```themesdir/templates/bricks/``` this folder is the home for all your new gutenberg blocks.  
included in the plugin directory there is a folder named example. this folder contains a readme and a folder for an example setup category and bricks. you can copy them to your new directory or continue with the documentation.

!> Note we can change this base directory naming later on [Overides](wpd_overides.md#admin-menu).
